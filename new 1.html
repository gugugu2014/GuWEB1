			<strong><u><h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2></u>
			<p style="margin-top:1px;">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
			<br>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:1px;">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
			<br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
			<br>With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
			<br>paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img / and input / directly introduce content into the page.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:1px;">Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
			<br>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
			<br>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
